Additionaly it creates meaningful data based on certain rules.

Details:
---------------------------------------
Farada comes with two main layers.

Layer 1 is the TestDataGeneration Layer and mainly responsible for filling complex types with data. 
Layer 2 is the Evolution Layer which builds upon Layer 1, but adds evolutionary rules in order to create meaningful data.
